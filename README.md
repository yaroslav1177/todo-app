This project is an interactive to-do list application. It allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks, providing a seamless way to manage daily activities. Built with React and TypeScript, the application ensures type safety and scalability, making the codebase robust and easy to maintain.

The app features dynamic task management, where users can mark tasks as completed or delete them entirely. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, offering a smooth experience across different devices. This project highlights my ability to create responsive and interactive applications using modern web development tools.
